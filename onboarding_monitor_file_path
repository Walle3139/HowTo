Overview ---Splunk---GUI----

	1. Create index=peoplesoft on NU ES-SH 
	2. Switch to splunk (sudo su splunk)
	3. On the DS in /deployment-apps, we're going to make an app directory (called whatever)
	4.  make local, make inputs.conf 
		1. monitor stanza for the file path, index, sourcetype
		2. double check permissions
		3. restart splunk
 
	1. Go onto front end GUI Deployment server (on the VDI) 
		1. Go to forwarder management
		2. Make server class that uses the app we just made and the host we need to push app to
	2. Check for logs on the ES 
		1. Alert
		2. CIM 
		3. Data masking (sensitive information)
